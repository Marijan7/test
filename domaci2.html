                              vrlo skromnu prisutnost - od 11. stoljeća pa do
                              1814., kada je vlast nad otokom mirno predana
                              Danskoj, čiji su kraljevi stoljećima prije toga
                              vladali Norveškom (u personalnoj uniji). <br />
                              Nakon Danskog preuzimanja, poduzeta je ozbiljnija
                              kolonizacija europskog stanovništva. Grenland je
                              1953. postao sastavni dijelom Danske. <br />
                              Lokalnu autonomiju su dobili u danskom parlamentu
                              1. svibnja 1979. 2008. godine Grenlanđani su
                              izglasovali prijenos više nadležnosti na lokalnu
                              vladu, što je stupilo na snagu 21. lipnja 2009.
                              <br />
                              Danska središnja vlada nadležna je samo za vanjsku
                              politiku, sigurnost te financijsku politiku.
                              Grenlandski glasači su referendumom 1985. godine
                              napustili Europsku ekonomsku zajednicu.</i

                  Kiviak: The Bizarre Greenland Inuit Seal Delicacy
            </h2>

            <img
                  src="./greenland-kiviak.jpg.webp"
                  alt="Greenland kiviak"

            />

            <p>
                  <i>
                        Kiviak (<mark>sometimes spelled Kiviaq</mark>) is quite
                        possibly one of the strangest, most bizarre delicacies
                        eaten anywhere in the world. A traditional dish eaten in
                        Greenland by inuits during the winter period,
                        particularly over Christmas, Kiviak consists of hundreds
                        of dead auk birds stuffed into a dead seal and left to
                        ferment under a rock for around three months. <br />
                        Yes, you read that correct! Around 400-500 dead auk
                        birds are used, because the seal needs to be packed very
                        tightly before being sealed and fermented. <br />
                        Inuits stuff in every part of the auk bird, feet,
                        feathers, beak, everything – sound delicious so far? I
                        thought not… <br />
                        <br />
                        <h3>Origins of Kiviaq</h3>

                        Originally made to ensure there was food available in
                        the bitter winter months, the seal fat is used to repel
                        flies, whereas the large rocks are there to keep as much
                        air out as possible to prevent it from going bad. <br />
                        <br />
                        Oils are also applied to the skin of the seal to prevent
                        maggots from infesting the carcass. <br />
                        Kiviak was a necessary source of vitamins and meat when
                        the cold, dark winters would make it difficult to find
                        food or dangerous because of unsafe ice. <br />
                        <br />
                        This method of storing and preparing over the winter
                        months would have saved many inuit lives in the far
                        north regions of Greenland. <br />
                        <br />
                        Whilst Kiviak may look disgusting, it is actually
                        considered to be a dish eaten on special occasions such
                        as Christmas or birthdays. <br />
                        In fact, in one tragic tale, an old, Greenlandic man
                        died from eating bad Kiviak and then at his funeral
                        guests were served more of the same dish, leading to a
                        widespread hospitalisation. <br />
                        <br />

                        <h3>How Kiviak is Eaten</h3>

                        The fermenting process means that the bird meat becomes
                        tenderised from the seal fat, allowing you to eat them
                        raw. The most popular way to consume Kiviak is to bite
                        off the head of the auk and suck out the juices. <br />
                        The feathers are torn off the bird and it is picked
                        clean and washed before being eaten. Chunks of the bird
                        meat can then just be eaten whole. <br />
                        The results are, as expected, a very sticky,
                        pungent-smelling meat that doesn’t appear to be very
                        appetizing. <br />
                        <br />
                        Of course, natives will tell you that it is, in fact,
                        very delicious as the fermenting has made the meat rich
                        in flavor. It is said to taste similar to mature cheeses
                        or liquorice. <br />
                        <br />
                        The best part of the Kiviak is said to be the heart. The
                        intestinal fluids can also be used in combination with
                        other foods or dishes as a sauce. Yum! <br />
                        Those who live in the cold countries close to the Arctic
                        circle have a bit of a reputation for eating stinky and
                        fishy dishes. For example, you may have heard of
                        Surströmming, the stinkiest fish in the world. Or
                        Hákarl, the rancid fermented shark delicacy. <br />
                        <br />
                        Greenlanders also like to eat chunks of rubbery whale
                        meat called Muktuk, so they’re no stranger to odd
                        foods!</i
