                              stoljeća pa do 1814., kada je vlast nad otokom
                              mirno predana Danskoj, čiji su kraljevi stoljećima <br>
                              prije toga vladali Norveškom u personalnoj uniji.

                              Nakon Danskog preuzimanja, poduzeta je ozbiljnija
                              kolonizacija europskog stanovništva. Grenland je
                              1953. postao sastavnim dijelom Danske. <br />
                              Lokalnu autonomiju su dobili u danskom parlamentu
                              1. svibnja 1979. <br />
                              2008. godine Grenlanđani su izglasovali prijenos
                              više nadležnosti na lokalnu vladu, što je stupilo
                              na snagu 21. lipnja 2009. <br />
                              Danska središnja vlada nadležna je samo za vanjsku
                              politiku, sigurnost te financijsku politiku.

                  Kiviak: The Bizarre Greenland Inuit Seal Delicacy
            </h2>

            />

            <p>
                  
                        Kiviak (<mark>sometimes spelled Kiviaq</mark>) is quite
                        possibly one of the strangest, most bizarre delicacies
                        eaten anywhere in the world. A traditional dish <br>
                         eaten in Greenland by inuits during the winter period,
                        particularly over Christmas, Kiviak consists of hundreds
                        of dead auk birds stuffed into a dead seal <br>
                         and left to ferment under a rock for around three months. <br />
                        Yes, you read that correct! Around 400-500 dead auk
                        birds are used, because the seal needs to be packed very
                        tightly before being sealed and fermented. <br />
                        Inuits stuff in every part of the auk bird, feet,
                        feathers, beak, everything – sound delicious so far? I
                        thought not… <br />
                        <br />
                        <h3>Origins of Kiviak</h3>

                        Originally made to ensure there was food available in
                        the bitter winter months, the seal fat is used to repel
                        flies, whereas the large rocks are there to keep <br>
                         as much air out as possible to prevent it from going bad. <br />
                        <br />
                        Oils are also applied to the skin of the seal to prevent
                        maggots from infesting the carcass. <br />
                        Kiviak was a necessary source of vitamins and meat when
                        the cold, dark winters would make it difficult to find
                        food or dangerous because of unsafe ice. <br />
                        <br />
                        This method of storing and preparing over the winter
                        months would have saved many inuit lives in the far
                        north regions of Greenland. <br />
                        <br />
                        Whilst Kiviak may look disgusting, it is actually
                        considered to be a dish eaten on special occasions such
                        as Christmas or birthdays. <br />
                        In fact, in one tragic tale, an old, Greenlandic man
                        died from eating bad Kiviak and then at his funeral
                        guests were served more of the same dish, <br>
                         leading to a widespread hospitalisation. <br />
                        <br />

                        <h3>How Kiviak is Eaten</h3>

                        The fermenting process means that the bird meat becomes
                        tenderised from the seal fat, allowing you to eat them
                        raw. The most popular way to consume <br>
                         Kiviak is to bite off the head of the auk and suck out the juices. <br />
                        The feathers are torn off the bird and it is picked
                        clean and washed before being eaten. Chunks of the bird
                        meat can then just be eaten whole. <br />
                        The results are, as expected, a very sticky,
                        pungent-smelling meat that doesn't appear to be very
                        appetizing. <br />
                        <br />
                        Of course, natives will tell you that it is, in fact,
                        very delicious as the fermenting has made the meat rich
                        in flavor. It is said to taste similar to mature <br>
                         cheeses or liquorice. <br />
                        <br />
                        The best part of the Kiviak is said to be the heart. The
                        intestinal fluids can also be used in combination with
                        other foods or dishes as a sauce. Yum! <br />
                        Those who live in the cold countries close to the Arctic
                        circle have a bit of a reputation for eating stinky and
                        fishy dishes. For example, you may <br>
                         have heard of Surströmming, the stinkiest fish in the world. Or
                        Hákarl, the rancid fermented shark delicacy. <br />
                        <br />
                        Greenlanders also like to eat chunks of rubbery whale
                        meat called Muktuk, so they're no stranger to odd
                        foods!</cite> <br> <br>
